It is not necessary to have a ScriptForge package to take advantage of
ScritForge Typings.

ScriptForge lives inside of LibreOffice. Using these typings in an moder development IDE
will give type Support for the ScriptForge library.

This project leverages `types-unopy <https://github.com/Amourspirit/python-types-unopy>`_ that gives
full typing support for `LibreOffice API <https://api.libreoffice.org/>`_.
This allows full type support for `ScriptForge <https://gitlab.com/LibreOfficiant/scriptforge>`_
and `LibreOffice API <https://api.libreoffice.org/>`_.

These Typings are created for LibreOffice ``7.3``.
