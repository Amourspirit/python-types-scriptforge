will give type Support for the ScriptForge library.

This project leverages `types-unopy <https://github.com/Amourspirit/python-types-unopy>`_ that gives
full typing support for `LibreOffice API <https://api.libreoffice.org/>`_.
This allows full type support for `ScriptForge <https://gitlab.com/LibreOfficiant/scriptforge>`_
